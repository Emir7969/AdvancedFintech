\f0\fs24 \cf0 The primary purpose of JavaScript is to enable interactive web pages. Because of dynamic typing, you are spared from specifying the kind of data that a variable contains. Though it is somewhat object-oriented, it lacks the structure of languages such as Java. This is the role of TypeScript. JavaScript with more structure is what TypeScript is like. It makes advantage of static typing, which lets you specify in advance what kind of data a variable contains. By doing this, errors can be found before the code is executed. Additionally, TypeScript includes tools that facilitate code writing and management, such as classes and interfaces.}
